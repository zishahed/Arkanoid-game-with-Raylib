# Arkanoid-game-with-Raylib
For the project for Structured Programming Language, we have chosen to recreate one of the classic games, ” Arkanoid”. It was a very popular arcade game and was later introduced for PCs and Laptops. In order to recreate this nostalgic game, we are going to use C programming language along with the raylib.
